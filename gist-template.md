# Understanding the Email Regex Pattern

In this tutorial, we will explore a commonly used regular expression (regex) pattern designed to validate email addresses. By the end of this tutorial, youâ€™ll understand each part of the pattern and how it works together to ensure a string is a valid email address.

## Regex Summary
The regular expression we are working with is:

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

This pattern ensures that the input string matches the structure of a valid email address, which typically includes a username, followed by the "@" symbol, a domain name, and a top-level domain.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
^ and $
^: The ^ symbol signifies the start of the string. It ensures that the regex pattern matches from the very beginning of the string.
$: The $ symbol signifies the end of the string. It ensures that the entire string must match the regex pattern, preventing any extra characters before or after the email.
